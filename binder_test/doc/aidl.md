# Android Interface Definition Language (AIDL)

The Android Interface Definition Language (AIDL) is similar to other [IDLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language) you might have worked with. It allows you to define the programming interface that both the client and service agree upon in order to communicate with each other using interprocess communication (IPC). On Android, one process cannot normally access the memory of another process. So to talk, they need to decompose their objects into primitives that the operating system can understand, and marshall the objects across that boundary for you. The code to do that marshalling is tedious to write, so Android handles it for you with AIDL.

**Note:** Using AIDL is necessary only if you allow clients from different applications to access your service for IPC and want to handle multithreading in your service. If you do not need to perform concurrent IPC across different applications, you should create your interface by [implementing a Binder](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/bound-services#Binder) or, if you want to perform IPC, but do *not* need to handle multithreading, implement your interface [using a Messenger](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/bound-services#Messenger). Regardless, be sure that you understand [Bound Services](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/bound-services) before implementing an AIDL.

Before you begin designing your AIDL interface, be aware that calls to an AIDL interface are direct function calls. You should not make assumptions about the thread in which the call occurs. What happens is different depending on whether the call is from a thread in the local process or a remote process. Specifically:

- Calls made from the local process are executed in the same thread that is making the call. If this is your main UI thread, that thread continues to execute in the AIDL interface. If it is another thread, that is the one that executes your code in the service. Thus, if only local threads are accessing the service, you can completely control which threads are executing in it (but if that is the case, then you shouldn't be using AIDL at all, but should instead create the interface by [implementing a Binder](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/bound-services#Binder)).
- Calls from a remote process are dispatched from a thread pool the platform maintains inside of your own process. You must be prepared for incoming calls from unknown threads, with multiple calls happening at the same time. In other words, an implementation of an AIDL interface must be completely thread-safe. Calls made from one thread on same remote object arrive **in order** on the receiver end.
- The `oneway` keyword modifies the behavior of remote calls. When used, a remote call does not block; it simply sends the transaction data and immediately returns. The implementation of the interface eventually receives this as a regular call from the `Binder` thread pool as a normal remote call. If `oneway` is used with a local call, there is no impact and the call is still synchronous.

## Defining an AIDL interface

You must define your AIDL interface in an `.aidl` file using the Java programming language syntax, then save it in the source code (in the `src/` directory) of both the application hosting the service and any other application that binds to the service.

When you build each application that contains the `.aidl` file, the Android SDK tools generate an `IBinder` interface based on the `.aidl` file and save it in the project's `gen/` directory. The service must implement the `IBinder` interface as appropriate. The client applications can then bind to the service and call methods from the `IBinder` to perform IPC.

To create a bounded service using AIDL, follow these steps:

1. Create the .aidl file

   This file defines the programming interface with method signatures.

2. Implement the interface

   The Android SDK tools generate an interface in the Java programming language, based on your `.aidl` file. This interface has an inner abstract class named `Stub` that extends `Binder` and implements methods from your AIDL interface. You must extend the `Stub` class and implement the methods.

3. Expose the interface to clients

   Implement a `Service` and override `onBind()` to return your implementation of the `Stub` class.

**Caution:** Any changes that you make to your AIDL interface after your first release must remain backward compatible in order to avoid breaking other applications that use your service. That is, because your `.aidl` file must be copied to other applications in order for them to access your service's interface, you must maintain support for the original interface.

### 1. Create the .aidl file

AIDL uses a simple syntax that lets you declare an interface with one or more methods that can take parameters and return values. The parameters and return values can be of any type, even other AIDL-generated interfaces.

You must construct the `.aidl` file using the Java programming language. Each `.aidl` file must define a single interface and requires only the interface declaration and method signatures.

By default, AIDL supports the following data types:

- All primitive types in the Java programming language (such as `int`, `long`, `char`, `boolean`, and so on)

- Arrays of primitive types such as `int[]`

- `String`

- `CharSequence`

- ```
  List
  ```

  All elements in the `List` must be one of the supported data types in this list or one of the other AIDL-generated interfaces or parcelables you've declared. A `List` may optionally be used as a parameterized type class (for example, `List<String>`). The actual concrete class that the other side receives is always an `ArrayList`, although the method is generated to use the `List` interface.

- ```
  Map
  ```

  All elements in the `Map` must be one of the supported data types in this list or one of the other AIDL-generated interfaces or parcelables you've declared. Parameterized type maps, (such as those of the form `Map<String,Integer>`) are not supported. The actual concrete class that the other side receives is always a `HashMap`, although the method is generated to use the `Map` interface. Consider using a `Bundle` as an alternative to `Map`.

You must include an `import` statement for each additional type not listed above, even if they are defined in the same package as your interface.

When defining your service interface, be aware that:

- Methods can take zero or more parameters, and return a value or void.

- All non-primitive parameters require a directional tag indicating which way the data goes. Either

   

  ```
  in
  ```

  ,

   

  ```
  out
  ```

  , or

   

  ```
  inout
  ```

   

  (see the example below).

  Primitives, `String`, `IBinder`, and AIDL-generated interfaces are `in` by default, and cannot be otherwise.

  **Caution:** You should limit the direction to what is truly needed, because marshalling parameters is expensive.

- All code comments included in the `.aidl` file are included in the generated `IBinder` interface (except for comments before the import and package statements).

- String and int constants can be defined in the AIDL interface. For example: `const int VERSION = 1;`.

- Method calls are dispatched by a [transact() code](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/IBinder#transact(int, android.os.Parcel, android.os.Parcel, int)), which normally is based on a method index in the interface. Because this makes versioning difficult, you could manually assign the transaction code to a method: `void method() = 10;`.

- Nullable arguments and return types must be annotated using `@nullable`.

Here is an example `.aidl` file:

```
// IRemoteService.aidl
package com.example.android;

// Declare any non-default types here with import statements

/** Example service interface */
interface IRemoteService {
    /** Request the process ID of this service, to do evil things with it. */
    int getPid();

    /** Demonstrates some basic types that you can use as parameters
     * and return values in AIDL.
     */
    void basicTypes(int anInt, long aLong, boolean aBoolean, float aFloat,
            double aDouble, String aString);
}
```

Simply save your `.aidl` file in your project's `src/` directory and when you build your application, the SDK tools generate the `IBinder` interface file in your project's `gen/` directory. The generated file name matches the `.aidl` file name, but with a `.java` extension (for example, `IRemoteService.aidl` results in `IRemoteService.java`).

If you use Android Studio, the incremental build generates the binder class almost immediately. If you do not use Android Studio, then the Gradle tool generates the binder class next time you build your applicationâ€”you should build your project with `gradle assembleDebug` (or `gradle assembleRelease`) as soon as you're finished writing the `.aidl` file, so that your code can link against the generated class.

### 2. Implement the interface

When you build your application, the Android SDK tools generate a `.java` interface file named after your `.aidl` file. The generated interface includes a subclass named `Stub` that is an abstract implementation of its parent interface (for example, `YourInterface.Stub`) and declares all the methods from the `.aidl` file.

**Note:** `Stub` also defines a few helper methods, most notably `asInterface()`, which takes an `IBinder` (usually the one passed to a client's `onServiceConnected()` callback method) and returns an instance of the stub interface. See the section [Calling an IPC Method](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/aidl.html#Calling) for more details on how to make this cast.

To implement the interface generated from the `.aidl`, extend the generated `Binder` interface (for example, `YourInterface.Stub`) and implement the methods inherited from the `.aidl` file.

Here is an example implementation of an interface called `IRemoteService` (defined by the `IRemoteService.aidl` example, above) using an anonymous instance:

[KOTLIN](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/aidl.html#kotlin)[JAVA](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/aidl.html#java)

```kotlin
private val binder = object : IRemoteService.Stub() {

    override fun getPid(): Int =
            Process.myPid()

    override fun basicTypes(
            anInt: Int,
            aLong: Long,
            aBoolean: Boolean,
            aFloat: Float,
            aDouble: Double,
            aString: String
    ) {
        // Does nothing
    }
}
```

Now the `binder` is an instance of the `Stub` class (a `Binder`), which defines the RPC interface for the service. In the next step, this instance is exposed to clients so they can interact with the service.

There are a few rules you should be aware of when implementing your AIDL interface:

- Incoming calls are not guaranteed to be executed on the main thread, so you need to think about multithreading from the start and properly build your service to be thread-safe.
- By default, RPC calls are synchronous. If you know that the service takes more than a few milliseconds to complete a request, you should not call it from the activity's main thread, because it might hang the application (Android might display an "Application is Not Responding" dialog)â€”you should usually call them from a separate thread in the client.
- No exceptions that you throw are sent back to the caller.

### 3. Expose the interface to clients

Once you've implemented the interface for your service, you need to expose it to clients so they can bind to it. To expose the interface for your service, extend `Service` and implement `onBind()` to return an instance of your class that implements the generated `Stub` (as discussed in the previous section). Here's an example service that exposes the `IRemoteService` example interface to clients.

[KOTLIN](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/aidl.html#kotlin)[JAVA](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/aidl.html#java)

```kotlin
class RemoteService : Service() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
    }

    override fun onBind(intent: Intent): IBinder {
        // Return the interface
        return binder
    }


    private val binder = object : IRemoteService.Stub() {
        override fun getPid(): Int {
            return Process.myPid()
        }

        override fun basicTypes(
                anInt: Int,
                aLong: Long,
                aBoolean: Boolean,
                aFloat: Float,
                aDouble: Double,
                aString: String
        ) {
            // Does nothing
        }
    }
}
```

Now, when a client (such as an activity) calls `bindService()` to connect to this service, the client's `onServiceConnected()` callback receives the `binder` instance returned by the service's `onBind()` method.

The client must also have access to the interface class, so if the client and service are in separate applications, then the client's application must have a copy of the `.aidl` file in its `src/` directory (which generates the `android.os.Binder` interfaceâ€”providing the client access to the AIDL methods).

When the client receives the `IBinder` in the `onServiceConnected()` callback, it must call `*YourServiceInterface*.Stub.asInterface(service)` to cast the returned parameter to `*YourServiceInterface*` type. For example:

[KOTLIN](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/aidl.html#kotlin)[JAVA](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/aidl.html#java)

```kotlin
var iRemoteService: IRemoteService? = null

val mConnection = object : ServiceConnection {

    // Called when the connection with the service is established
    override fun onServiceConnected(className: ComponentName, service: IBinder) {
        // Following the example above for an AIDL interface,
        // this gets an instance of the IRemoteInterface, which we can use to call on the service
        iRemoteService = IRemoteService.Stub.asInterface(service)
    }

    // Called when the connection with the service disconnects unexpectedly
    override fun onServiceDisconnected(className: ComponentName) {
        Log.e(TAG, "Service has unexpectedly disconnected")
        iRemoteService = null
    }
}
```

For more sample code, see the [`RemoteService.java`](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/development/+/master/samples/ApiDemos/src/com/example/android/apis/app/RemoteService.java) class in [ApiDemos](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/development/+/master/samples/ApiDemos).

## Passing objects over IPC

In Android 10 (API level 29), you can define `Parcelable` objects directly in AIDL. Types which are supported as AIDL interface arguments and other parcelables are also supported here. This avoids the additional work to manually write marshalling code and a custom class. However, this will also create a bare struct. If custom accessors or other functionality is desired, `Parcelable` should be implemented instead.

```
package android.graphics;

// Declare Rect so AIDL can find it and knows that it implements
// the parcelable protocol.
parcelable Rect {
    int left;
    int top;
    int right;
    int bottom;
}
```

The code sample above automatically generate a Java class with integer fields `left`, `top`, `right`, and `bottom`. All relevant marshalling code is automatically implemented, and the object can be used directly without having to add any implementation.

You can also send a custom class from one process to another through an IPC interface. However, you must ensure that the code for your class is available to the other side of the IPC channel and your class must support the `Parcelable` interface. Supporting the `Parcelable` interface is important because it allows the Android system to decompose objects into primitives that can be marshalled across processes.

To create a custom class that supports the `Parcelable` protocol, you must do the following:

1. Make your class implement the `Parcelable` interface.

2. Implement `writeToParcel`, which takes the current state of the object and writes it to a `Parcel`.

3. Add a static field called `CREATOR` to your class which is an object implementing the `Parcelable.Creator` interface.

4. Finally, create an

    

   ```
   .aidl
   ```

    

   file that declares your parcelable class (as shown for the

    

   ```
   Rect.aidl
   ```

    

   file, below).

   If you are using a custom build process, do *not* add the `.aidl` file to your build. Similar to a header file in the C language, this `.aidl` file isn't compiled.

AIDL uses these methods and fields in the code it generates to marshall and unmarshall your objects.

For example, here is a `Rect.aidl` file to create a `Rect` class that's parcelable:

```
package android.graphics;

// Declare Rect so AIDL can find it and knows that it implements
// the parcelable protocol.
parcelable Rect;
```

And here is an example of how the `Rect` class implements the `Parcelable` protocol.

[KOTLIN](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/aidl.html#kotlin)[JAVA](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/aidl.html#java)

```kotlin
import android.os.Parcel
import android.os.Parcelable

class Rect() : Parcelable {
    var left: Int = 0
    var top: Int = 0
    var right: Int = 0
    var bottom: Int = 0

    companion object CREATOR : Parcelable.Creator<Rect> {
        override fun createFromParcel(parcel: Parcel): Rect {
            return Rect(parcel)
        }

        override fun newArray(size: Int): Array<Rect> {
            return Array(size) { Rect() }
        }
    }

    private constructor(inParcel: Parcel) : this() {
        readFromParcel(inParcel)
    }

    override fun writeToParcel(outParcel: Parcel, flags: Int) {
        outParcel.writeInt(left)
        outParcel.writeInt(top)
        outParcel.writeInt(right)
        outParcel.writeInt(bottom)
    }

    private fun readFromParcel(inParcel: Parcel) {
        left = inParcel.readInt()
        top = inParcel.readInt()
        right = inParcel.readInt()
        bottom = inParcel.readInt()
    }

    override fun describeContents(): Int {
        return 0
    }
}
```

The marshalling in the `Rect` class is pretty simple. Take a look at the other methods on `Parcel` to see the other kinds of values you can write to a Parcel.

**Warning:** Don't forget the security implications of receiving data from other processes. In this case, the `Rect` reads four numbers from the `Parcel`, but it is up to you to ensure that these are within the acceptable range of values for whatever the caller is trying to do. See [Security and Permissions](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/security) for more information about how to keep your application secure from malware.

## Methods with Bundle arguments containing Parcelables

If your aidl interface includes methods that accept Bundle as arguments which is expected to contain parcelables, please ensure you set the classloader of the Bundle by calling `Bundle.setClassLoader(ClassLoader)` before attempting to read from the Bundle. Otherwise, you will run into `ClassNotFoundException` even though the parcelable is correctly defined in your application. For example,

if you have an `.aidl` file:

```java
// IRectInsideBundle.aidl
package com.example.android;

/** Example service interface */
interface IRectInsideBundle {
    /** Rect parcelable is stored in the bundle with key "rect" */
    void saveRect(in Bundle bundle);
}
```

As can be seen from the implementation below, the `ClassLoader` is being explicitly set in the `Bundle` before reading `Rect`

[KOTLIN](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/aidl.html#kotlin)[JAVA](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/aidl.html#java)

```kotlin
private val binder = object : IRectInsideBundle.Stub() {
    override fun saveRect(bundle: Bundle) {
      bundle.classLoader = classLoader
      val rect = bundle.getParcelable<Rect>("rect")
      process(rect) // Do more with the parcelable
    }
}
```

## Calling an IPC method

Here are the steps a calling class must take to call a remote interface defined with AIDL:

1. Include the `.aidl` file in the project `src/` directory.
2. Declare an instance of the `IBinder` interface (generated based on the AIDL).
3. Implement `ServiceConnection`.
4. Call `Context.bindService()`, passing in your `ServiceConnection` implementation.
5. In your implementation of `onServiceConnected()`, you will receive an `IBinder` instance (called `service`). Call `*YourInterfaceName*.Stub.asInterface((IBinder)*service*)` to cast the returned parameter to *YourInterface* type.
6. Call the methods that you defined on your interface. You should always trap `DeadObjectException` exceptions, which are thrown when the connection has broken. You should also trap `SecurityException` exceptions, which are thrown when the two processes involved in the IPC method call have conflicting AIDL definitions.
7. To disconnect, call `Context.unbindService()` with the instance of your interface.

A few comments on calling an IPC service:

- Objects are reference counted across processes.
- You can send anonymous objects as method arguments.

Here is some sample code demonstrating calling an AIDL-created service, taken from the Remote Service sample in the ApiDemos project.
